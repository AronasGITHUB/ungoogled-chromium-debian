This is a patch to resolve issues where parts of the build system try to
reference the python executable through the symlink that is no longer
provided by Ubuntu. This patches these instances so that builds should
continue to work in spite of this change. This only patches the bare
minimum for the default builds so it may require additional work if
something different is done such as building a debug build.
